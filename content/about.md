I'm a VR/AR developer interested in creating positive impact through immersive technologies. I started my career as a Mechanical Engineer, a field in which strong project management and critical thinking skills are a must. After transitioning to tech, I learned the importance of designing experiences and documentation with the end user in mind. In addition to my experience with Unity, VR/AR SDKs, and related toolkits, I have worked extensively with front end programming languages, SaaS platforms, and Agile processes.
