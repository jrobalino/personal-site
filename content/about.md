I'm a front end and VR/AR developer interested in creating positive impact through web applications and immersive technologies. I started my career as a Mechanical Engineer, a field in which strong project management and critical thinking skills are a must. After transitioning to tech, I learned the importance of designing experiences with the end user in mind. I have experience working with:

* Front end frameworks like React.js
* Back end APIs built with Node.js
* Unity
* VR/AR SDKs like SteamVR
* SaaS platforms
* AWS services
* Agile processes
* Dev ops tools like Jenkins, Datadog, and Kibana

In addition to being a developer, I have extensive experiece serving as a developer advocate and building world-class documentation stacks.
