I'm a Developer Relations leader interested in creating positive impact through web applications and immersive technologies. I started my career as a Mechanical Engineer, a field in which strong project management and critical thinking skills are a must. After transitioning to tech, I learned the importance of designing experiences with the end user in mind. My career has taken me from building world-class documentation stacks to writing code as a front end developer to starting and running Developer Relations programs from scratch. I have experience working with:

* Developer portals
* Front end frameworks like React.js
* Back end APIs built with Node.js, Java, and .NET
* Unity
* VR/AR SDKs like SteamVR
* SaaS platforms
* AWS services
* Agile processes
* Dev ops tools like Jenkins, Datadog, and Kibana
* Communicating with internal and external stakeholders (partners, clients, C-suite, developers, technical writers, marketing, sales, business development)
* Working with and recruiting team members across multiple regions including USA, Belfast, and India
* Creating training programs and developer-focused blogs
* Designing scalable API programs and defining team roles for Engineering, QA, DevOps, Technical Writing, and Developer Advocates
