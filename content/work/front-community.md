The [Front Developer Community](https://community.front.com) is a space designed to make developers successful at building high-quality integrations on the Front Platform. The community features:

* A developer Q&A forum that allows user to ask questions and get answers. The forum allows users to select the best answer.
* A space to provide feedback to the Front team.
* The ability to subscribe to important news and updates regarding the API, including deprecations.
* A place to engage and become inspired by other developers.
* Gamification that allows users to earn badges and move up the community ranks.
* Integrations with various systems, such as Salesforce, an LMS, an idea portal, etc.
* Federated search that pulls in content from developer documentation and other sources.
* Beautiful branding that was the result of collaborating with the Marketing team.

I was responsible for the research to select a community vendor, obtaining approval and funding (note: Saas communities can be very expensive!), justifying the value of the community and the return on investment, configuring the community, creating integrations for the community using Node.js and other frameworks, project managing the branding of the community, testing the community before go live, coordinating the promotion plan and launch for the community, and helping to moderate and ensure the community's success.
