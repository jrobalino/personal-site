I built the technology stack for this documentation site using Jekyll and JavaScript. The site features:

* A modern and responsive design built on Jekyll and custom JavaScript and CSS (no pre-built theme).
* Search powered by AWS CloudSearch APIs and a batch script to create the search index.
* Easy content authoring in Markdown with full support for images, videos, code blocks, notes, accordions, tables, etc.
* Dynamic scrollspy menu.
* Custom toolbar for contacting Support, providing feedback, switching languages, or toggling elements on the page.
* Gulp-based build tool for generating test and production builds and a variety of other day-to-day tasks.
* Translation tools integrated with Jenkins and the Smartling API.
