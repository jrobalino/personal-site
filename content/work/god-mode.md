The video shows a quick walkthrough of my Udacity VR Developer Nanodegree capstone project. The experience casts players as a deity in charge of maintaining the status quo between a set of rich and poor dogs. Without pity, players must ration food unevenly, separate puppies from their parents, and risk the lives of poor dogs. Ultimately, players must sacrifice the souls of the poor dogs in order to bless the rich dogs. In return, players receive adoring worship from those that benefit. But is maintaining the status quo truly the only option?
