This React.js application allows users to view, edit, and request API keys for several public-facing APIs that a company offers. The application features:

* GET and POST operations to request and send data to internal APIs that manage client keys.
* A list of all keys a user has access to.
* The ability to filter, sort, and search for keys based on various criteria.
* Smart pagination and record counts.
* Use of local storage to save user filters.
* A details page that allows users to view and edit API keys depending on their permissions.
* A wizard to request new API keys.
* A permissions model that limits the views and actions a user can take depending on their account role and the client instances they have access to.
* A combination of React hooks, React class components, and JavaScript Promises to resolve and render API data as it updates.
* Validation and error messages in the UI.
* Translation into multiple languages.

I was one of three engineers that worked on this application.
